Some of them scaled well, others didn&amp;rsquo;t. A few worked great early on — but as the project grew, and new resources had to be added under time pressure and shifting priorities, the codebase became harder and harder to maintain.
It was still &amp;ldquo;infrastructure as code&amp;rdquo;, but each change took longer, and refactoring became too costly to be worth the effort.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
