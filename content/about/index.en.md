## Paweł Oczadły

> **Build systems that reduce noise, not just code that works.**

## Platform Engineer. Gradler.

I build systems, not _"setups"_. I focus on creating **repeatable, testable, and auditable** developer tools and infrastructure that naturally fit into engineering workflows.

### Work

Currently working at **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)** on building systems and internal developer platforms.

{{< admonition note "Note" >}}
*Posts about [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app), [Build Scans](https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/build_scans.html), or [Develocity](https://gradle.com/develocity/) reflect my **personal experiences and perspectives**. They are not official product endorsements or company statements but insights I've gained while working with these tools in real engineering workflows.*

### After work

I explore tools and approaches for building repeatable engineering workflows: from platform engineering and infrastructure to selected, practical applications of AI. These explorations often turn into **concrete, technical case studies** on the blog.


### Privately

Husband. Specialty coffee lover. EMTB rider. You can find my activity on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/67135909).

## Areas of focus

* Gradle, Groovy, Spring Boot
* OpenTofu, GitOps, modular (cloud) infrastructure
* RAG pipelines and selected elements of AI-native DX

## Why this blog

This blog is not a collection of tutorials or loose thoughts. It is a place where I document **structured, repeatable solutions** in the areas of:

* cloud architecture
* platform engineering
* AI-native tooling

All presented in a clear and accessible way.

This blog serves as my personal engineering compendium: a space I return to when designing systems, just like revisiting ADRs during architecture work.

It's my way of capturing patterns, learnings, and production-ready decisions that help me, and hopefully others, build **clean, scalable, and maintainable platforms**.

## Who this blog is for

* Platform Engineers looking for production-ready tooling.
* Software Engineers interested in clean CI/CD, Gradle, OpenTofu, and GitOps workflows.
* Engineers exploring practical applications of AI in the context of infrastructure and workflows.
* Anyone who values clarity, reproducibility, and systems thinking in engineering.
