## Platform Engineer. Gradler.

I build systems, not setups. My focus is on creating clean, reproducible developer tooling and infrastructure that scales, tests, and integrates seamlessly into engineering workflows.

### Work

Currently working at **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)** on building systems and internal developer platforms.

{{< admonition note "Note" >}}
*Posts about [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app), [Build Scans](https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/build_scans.html), or [Develocity](https://gradle.com/develocity/) reflect my **personal experiences and perspectives**. They are not official product endorsements or company statements but insights I've gained while working with these tools in real engineering workflows.*

### After work

Exploring tools for AI-native workflows and reproducible prompt registries.

### Privately

Husband. Specialty coffee lover. EMTB rider. You can find my activity on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/67135909).

## Areas of focus

* Gradle, Groovy, Spring Boot
* OpenTofu, GitOps, modular (cloud) infrastructure
* RAG pipelines, AI-native DX

## Why this blog

Besides keeping my code in repositories, I wanted a place to document **structured, reusable solutions** for:

* cloud architecture
* platform engineering
* AI-native tooling

Everything in a clear and accessible way.

This blog serves as my personal engineering compendium — a space I return to when designing systems, just like revisiting ADRs during architecture work.

It's my way of capturing patterns, learnings, and production-ready decisions that help me—and hopefully others—build **clean, scalable, and maintainable platforms**.

## Who this blog is for

* Platform Engineers looking for production-ready tooling.
* Software Engineers interested in clean CI/CD, Gradle, OpenTofu, and GitOps workflows.
* Developers exploring AI-native infrastructure and prompt engineering.
* Anyone who values clarity, reproducibility, and systems thinking in engineering.
