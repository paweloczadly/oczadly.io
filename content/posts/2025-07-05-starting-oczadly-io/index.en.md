Welcome to my blog!

I've built it to document and share my personal experiences in building solutions for cloud architecture, platform engineering, and AI-native tooling.

It will serve as my **personal engineering notebook** - a place to capture structured learnings, patterns, and decisionsâ€”cleanly and accessibly.

## What to expect

- Practical, implementation-focused posts.
- Structured patterns for building scalable platforms.
- Insights on Gradle, OpenTofu, GitOps workflows, and AI-native systems.
- Clean, minimal, and noise-free.
