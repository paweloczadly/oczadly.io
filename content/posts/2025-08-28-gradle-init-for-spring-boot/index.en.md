## Why yet another Gradle plugin

Recently, I wanted to deepen my understanding of [Build Scans](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/build_scans.html), [Develocity](https://gradle.com/develocity/), and their practical applications, so I started going through the courses on our [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog) platform. In my daily work, I interact with [Develocity](https://gradle.com/develocity/) from the operational and production side â€” maintaining [open-source instances](https://github.com/gradle/develocity-oss-projects) among other things â€” so I wanted to better understand the product, especially from the end-user perspective, to support my daily engineering work.

To systematize what I was learning, I decided to build a project that aligns with the best practices discussed in these courses. At the same time, I was working on a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) microservice generated via [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) and noticed there was no [Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/plugins.html) that would automate this process in a way that is build cache-friendly and CI/CD-friendly.

Thatâ€™s how the [gradle-springinitializr-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr) was bornâ€”a production-ready tool that simplifies bootstrapping [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) projects directly from [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). This post covers how it was built, how it works, and how you can use it to speed up starting new projects within your team.

{{< admonition example "Quick start" >}}
The plugin is open-source and available on the [Gradle - Plugins](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr). You can install and start using it right away.

Create the `build.gradle` file and add the following:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'io.oczadly.springinitializr' version '1.0.0'
}
```

Create the `settings.gradle` file and add this configuration:

```groovy
rootProject.name = 'examples-simple-groovy'
```

Or add it to your existing project.

This way, you can generate new [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) projects with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) while reading this post, accelerating your onboarding and daily work.

I treat this plugin as a reference: how to build a production-ready plugin in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) consistent with [Gradle best practices](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/best_practices_general.html). If you build plugins yourself, you can use it as a point of reference.

## Who is this plugin for

**Platform Engineers**

[gradle-springinitializr-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr) can become a part of your platform to accelerate microservice scaffolding across your organization. With it, you can:

âœ… Quickly generate [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) microservices ([Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/)/[Java](https://www.java.com/)/[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)/[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)) from CLI, pipelines, or automated [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) processes.

âœ… Always generate projects with the latest [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Java](https://www.java.com/), and dependency versions, eliminating the need to manually maintain templates.

âœ… Provide a build cache-aware, CI-friendly workflow from day one of your projects.

âœ… Standardize project structure, metadata (groupId, artifactId, packageName, description), and the microservice creation process.

If you are building an engineering platform for JVM-based developer teams, this plugin can become a lightweight, configurable, and automatable pipeline element for "just-in-time" scaffolding of [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) projects.

**Software Engineers**

[gradle-springinitializr-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr) can become your go-to tool for quickly starting [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) projects without leaving the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) ecosystem.
Instead of clicking through the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) web UI or writing curl commands, you can generate a fully customizable project with a single [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) command.
It saves time, ensures consistent configurations, and integrates immediately into your build cache, CI/CD, and team conventions.

**The Curious and Mindful**

[gradle-springinitializr-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr) lets you see how [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project generation from [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) works in under a minute, without clicking around https://start.spring.io or writing curl commands. Instead of manually downloading ZIP files, you can instantly start a project locally and explore [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) in a repeatable, clean, and user-friendly way.

---

## How it works

After installing the [gradle-springinitializr-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr), you can generate [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) projects directly from [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) without leaving your terminal.

The plugin provides a single task `initSpringBootProject`, which downloads a project from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) and extracts it. Instead of clicking in the web interface, simply run:

```shell
gradle initSpringBootProject
```

You will get:

```text
> Task :initSpringBootProject
Downloading Spring Boot starter project...
Project downloaded to: /opt/my-projects/build/generated-project/starter.zip
Project extracted to: /opt/my-projects/build/generated-project/demo

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
```

By default the project will be downloaded and extracted into `build/generated-project/demo`, ready to open and run.

The plugin also allows you to set any parameter available in [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io):

```shell
gradle initSpringBootProject \
    -PprojectType="gradle-project-kotlin" \
    -Planguage="kotlin" \
    -PgroupId="com.mycompany" \
    -PartifactId="my-spring-app" \
    -PprojectName="My Spring App" \
    -PprojectDescription="My Spring Boot application generated via gradle-springinitializr-plugin" \
    -PpackageName="com.mycompany.myspringapp" \
    -Ppackaging="war" \
    -PjavaVersion="21" \
    -Pdependencies="web,actuator"
    -PoutputDir="/opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app"
```

This way you generate clean, consistent projects ready for your CI/CD workflow and aligned with team conventions â€“ without manual steps.

The plugin also supports an experimental interactive mode inspired by `gradle init`:

![gradle init dla Spring Boot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paweloczadly/gradle-springinitializr-plugin/refs/tags/v1.0.0/docs/images/demo.gif "gradle init for Spring Boot")

This allows you to enter all project parameters without remembering command line flags â€“ the plugin guides you step by step through choosing [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) version, language, project type, and dependencies. Itâ€™s particularly useful for new team members or when you want to quickly prepare a project aligned with your organizationâ€™s standards.

{{< admonition warning "WARNING" >}}
Interactive mode is still experimental â€” great for learning and quick start. In CI/CD pipelines I recommend explicit -P flags.
{{< /admonition >}}

To use interactive mode, follow the instructions in the [FAQ](https://github.com/paweloczadly/gradle-springinitializr-plugin/blob/v1.0.0/FAQ.md#is-interactive-mode-supported).

## How itâ€™s built

As mentioned earlier, besides using knowledge from [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog), I wanted this plugin to be a **reference implementation** for building further plugins. My goal was to create something solid, nearly maintenance-free, and as timeless as possible.

### `plugin.properties`

The heart of the plugin is the `plugin.properties` file, which contains default parameter values. This supports the principle of _separating code and configuration_ - changes to values do not require code modification or recompilation, just file replacement.

Properties are loaded once at plugin startup and available through static constants:

```groovy
PluginConfig.getOrThrow(PluginConstants.PLUGIN_ID)
```

This approach simplifies both production and test configuration â€“ giving full control over the environment without changes to plugin logic.

{{< admonition success "Lessons from functional tests" >}}
For `plugin.properties` to be visible in functional tests as a resource, add to `build.gradle`:

```groovy
sourceSets {
    functionalTest {
        resources.srcDir file('src/main/resources')
    }
}
```

This way functional tests use exactly the same configuration as the production plugin.
{{< /admonition >}}

### `convention`: clean plugin configuration

Options such as `initializrUrl`, `metadataEndpoint` and `extract` are designed as **global plugin configuration** â€“ they concern the source of data (*where* to fetch the project from), not the project content itself (*what* it should include). This keeps separation between infrastructural configuration and actual generation logic.

Default values are set using [`convention(...)`](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/lazy_configuration.html#applying_conventions) in [Gradle](https://gradle.org) - which means:

* the user *does not have to set anything* to use the plugin in default mode,
* but *can override* any value in build.gradle, for example to use their own [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) instance or disable ZIP extraction:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'io.oczadly.springinitializr' version '1.0.0'
}

tasks.named('initSpringBootProject') {
    initializrUrl = 'https://your-initializr.example.com'
    metadataEndpoint = '/yours'
    extract = 'false'
}
```

This approach provides:

* **clean builds** â€“ no mixing of configuration with invocation parameters.
* **predictability** â€“ the plugin always works on explicitly defined inputs.
* **flexibility** â€“ the user can point to a custom endpoint, e.g. in CI or a mirror.

See [official Gradle documentation on `convention(...)`](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/lazy_configuration.html#applying_conventions) for more details on setting clear, overridable defaults in your plugins and tasks.

### Extracting available options from Metadata API

The plugin fetches supported versions of [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), project types, and languages available after downloading from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io). This is done via the [Metadata endpoint](https://docs.spring.io/initializr/docs/current/reference/html/#project-metadata). Thanks to this, there is no need to constantly update the plugin for supported parameters.

While adding supported project types and languages I encountered an interesting issue with [configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/configuration_cache.html) in [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). More on this below.

{{< admonition success "Lessons from using â€“configuration-cache" >}}
At first I ran into problems testing the plugin with the `--configuration-cache` flag. Initially I thought the issue was reading `plugin.properties`, but the real cause was using the `project.*` API in the class extending `DefaultTask`:

```groovy
package io.oczadly.tasks

abstract class InitSpringBootProjectTask extends DefaultTask {

  @Internal
  final ListProperty<String> supportedProjectTypes = project.objects.listProperty String

  @Internal
  final ListProperty<String> supportedLanguages = project.objects.listProperty String

  @TaskAction
  void download() {
    /* Remaining code omitted for clarity */
  }
}
```

This breaks [configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/configuration_cache.html), because [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) requires all inputs to be explicitly declared using `Property<T>`, `Provider<T>` or `DirectoryProperty`. Then during execution phase you cannot refer to mutable project state.

I solved this by:

- [x] Moving all logic of fetching supported project types and languages into the download() method.
- [x] Ensuring that `@TaskAction` operates only on properties declared as `Property<T>` or `Provider<T>`, evaluated at execution time.

This change not only enabled [configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/configuration_cache.html) compatibility, but also led to a cleaner, more idiomatic implementation aligned with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) practices.

See [official Gradle documentation on configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/configuration_cache.html) for all details and limitations.
{{< /admonition >}}

### `-P` parameters and validation mechanism

The plugin accepts all parameters available at https://start.spring.io â€” the same ones you can set in the web UI of [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io).

After users set parameters or default values are assigned, validation is performed inside the `initSpringBootProject` task. At the beginning, the task fetches the list of supported [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) versions, project types, and languages from the [Metadata endpoint](https://docs.spring.io/initializr/docs/current/reference/html/#project-metadata). If a user provides an invalid parameter value that is not supported, the task will fail. For example:

```shell
gradle initSpringBootProject -Planguage=clojure
```

Will result in the message:

```text
> Task :initSpringBootProject FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':initSpringBootProject'.
> Unsupported language: 'clojure'. Supported: java, kotlin, groovy.

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
> Get more help at https://help.gradle.org.

BUILD FAILED in 5s
```

### Incremental build and build cache

Based on the [Gradle Build Caching path](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/learning_paths/b82f8dd7-d61e-450f-820e-3e719ef70bee) at [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog) and the knowledge gained there, the plugin was given support for [incremental build](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/incremental_build.html) and [Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/build_cache.html). Thanks to this, subsequent executions are instant, and results can be reused.

The `initSpringBootProject` task declares both inputs (`@Input`) and outputs (`@OutputDirectory` â€” in this case `outputDir`, tied to a `DirectoryProperty`). This is aligned with the definition of a correctly configured task in [Gradle](https://gradle.org), described here.

Thanks to this, [Gradle](https://gradle.org) has full control over tracking the state of inputs and outputs, which enables:

* Skipping the task (`UP-TO-DATE`) if the outputs have not changed â€” incremental build.
* Restoring results (`FROM-CACHE`) if outputs exist in the local cache â€” build cache.

Below is an example of how the task behaves in both cases.

#### Incremental build

On the first run, the project is downloaded from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io):

```shell
gradle initSpringBootProject -PoutputDir=/opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app --console=plain --info
```

You will see:

```text

...

Task name matched 'initSpringBootProject'
Selected primary task 'initSpringBootProject' from project :
Tasks to be executed: [task ':initSpringBootProject']
Tasks that were excluded: []
Resolve mutations for :initSpringBootProject (Thread[included builds,5,main]) started.
:initSpringBootProject (Thread[included builds,5,main]) started.

> Task :initSpringBootProject
Build cache key for task ':initSpringBootProject' is 75b4d5a65d989aa6453584fe39baeab5
Task ':initSpringBootProject' is not up-to-date because:
  No history is available.
Downloading Spring Boot starter project...
Project downloaded to: /opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app/starter.zip
Project extracted to: /opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app/demo
Stored cache entry for task ':initSpringBootProject' with cache key 75b4d5a65d989aa6453584fe39baeab5

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 12s
5 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 4 up-to-date
```

On subsequent runs with the same `-PoutputDir` parameter:

```shell
gradle initSpringBootProject -PoutputDir=/opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app --console=plain --info
```

Since the outputs havenâ€™t changed, youâ€™ll see:

```text
...

Task name matched 'initSpringBootProject'
Selected primary task 'initSpringBootProject' from project :
Tasks to be executed: [task ':initSpringBootProject']
Tasks that were excluded: []
Resolve mutations for :initSpringBootProject (Thread[Execution worker Thread 4,5,main]) started.
:initSpringBootProject (Thread[Execution worker Thread 4,5,main]) started.

> Task :initSpringBootProject UP-TO-DATE
Build cache key for task ':initSpringBootProject' is 75b4d5a65d989aa6453584fe39baeab5
Skipping task ':initSpringBootProject' as it is up-to-date.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 383ms
5 actionable tasks: 5 up-to-date
```

Which confirms that incremental build was used, marked with the `UP-TO-DATE` label.

#### Build cache

If the file `/opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app/starter.zip` is deleted and the task is run again:

```shell
gradle initSpringBootProject -PoutputDir=/opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app --console=plain --info
```

Since the outputs were previously added to the local cache, the response will show:

```text

...

Task name matched 'initSpringBootProject'
Selected primary task 'initSpringBootProject' from project :
Tasks to be executed: [task ':initSpringBootProject']
Tasks that were excluded: []
Resolve mutations for :initSpringBootProject (Thread[included builds,5,main]) started.
:initSpringBootProject (Thread[included builds,5,main]) started.

> Task :initSpringBootProject FROM-CACHE
Build cache key for task ':initSpringBootProject' is 75b4d5a65d989aa6453584fe39baeab5
Task ':initSpringBootProject' is not up-to-date because:
  Output property 'outputDir' file /opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app has been removed.
  Output property 'outputDir' file /opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app/demo has been removed.
  Output property 'outputDir' file /opt/my-projects/my-spring-boot-app/demo/build.gradle has been removed.
  and more...
Loaded cache entry for task ':initSpringBootProject' with cache key 75b4d5a65d989aa6453584fe39baeab5

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 416ms
5 actionable tasks: 1 from cache, 4 up-to-date
```

This confirms that the local build cache was used, indicated by the `FROM-CACHE` label.

{{< admonition success "Lessons from the Gradle Build Cache path (DPE University" >}}
While going through the [Gradle Build Caching path](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/learning_paths/b82f8dd7-d61e-450f-820e-3e719ef70bee) at [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog), I became curious about how exactly the local build cache works and what actually goes inside it. I decided to break it down.

After running the `initSpringBootProject` task, the build cache key `75b4d5a65d989aa6453584fe39baeab5` stands out. Thatâ€™s an archive located in `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/caches/build-cache-1`. When unpacked, you can see, among others, a `METADATA` file that contains:

```properties
#Generated origin information
#Sun Jul 13 13:47:46 CEST 2025
executionTime=787
creationTime=1752677283570
identity=\:initSpringBootProject
buildInvocationId=b6ynyhegwjcl5ojld4csg2g7ee
buildCacheKey=75b4d5a65d989aa6453584fe39baeab5
type=org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.TaskExecution
gradleVersion=8.14
```

In the `tree-outputDir/` folder there is the archived `starter.zip` file and the project folder â€” exactly what was previously downloaded from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) and saved as the taskâ€™s outputs.
{{< /admonition >}}

For more on incremental build and Build Cache, see the official documentation:

ðŸ‘‰ [Incremental build](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/incremental_build.html).

ðŸ‘‰ [Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/build_cache.html).

### Interactive mode

To preserve compatibility with incremental build and build cache, `upToDateWhen` and `cacheIf` were used accordingly.

---

## Production readiness

When building this plugin I wanted it to be **ready for production use** from day one. That means not just "it works on my machine", but it is tested, validated, analyzable, and integrated with CI/CD.

### Unit tests

Written in [Spock](https://spockframework.org). They cover key functionalities such as parameter validation, building queries to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io), and extraction. In line with the testing pyramid, these are the most numerous tests in the project.

### Functional tests

Also written in [Spock](https://spockframework.org), this time using [Gradle TestKit](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/test_kit.html). In addition, I test JSON responses from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) with [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/), following the official [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/initializr/docs/current/reference/html/#using-the-stubs) recommended by the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) team.

{{< admonition success "Lessons from using TestKit in Spock" >}}
At the beginning, while working on functional tests, I ran into a case described in the TestKit documentation in the section [Controlling the build environment](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/test_kit.html#sec:controlling_the_build_environment).

Even though the `initSpringBootProject` task executed successfully and in the logs I could see:

```text
> Task :initSpringBootProject
Project downloaded to: /private/var/folders/lj/q3_9z0ws4ygb_bvng5vy2vs00000gn/T/spock_initSpringBootProje_0_testProjectDir13964729921630795147/build/generated-project/starter.zip
Project extracted to: /private/var/folders/lj/q3_9z0ws4ygb_bvng5vy2vs00000gn/T/spock_initSpringBootProje_0_testProjectDir13964729921630795147/build/generated-project/demo

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
```

The tests did not pass, and I was getting the following message in the logs:

```text
Condition not satisfied:

FilesTestUtils.projectFilesExist unzipDir, 'build.gradle', 'src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java'
|              |                 |
|              false             /var/folders/lj/q3_9z0ws4ygb_bvng5vy2vs00000gn/T/spock_initSpringBootProje_0_testProjectDir8148397175690448479/generated-project/demo
class io.oczadly.testsupport.FilesTestUtils
```

The issue came from the fact that [Gradle TestKit](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/test_kit.html) always runs the build in an isolated working directory inside `java.io.tmpdir` (e.g. `/private/var/folders/.../build/`), and not in the directory where I expected the files.

However, in the assertion (`generatedProjectDir.absolutePath`) it was looking for files in Spockâ€™s temporary directory (`@TempDir`), which is a different location than the working directory used by [TestKit](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/test_kit.html).

I solved it by:

- [x] Setting `-PoutputDir=${generatedProjectDir.absolutePath}`, which forced the plugin to save files in the place expected by the test.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Static code analysis

Every tool released for use should include a mechanism for static code analysis. In this case, the [CodeNarc plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/codenarc_plugin.html) was used, with a necessary set of rules useful for tools like [Gradle](https://gradle.org) plugins.

### Test coverage

As mentioned earlier, [gradle-springinitializr-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr) is covered by both unit and functional tests. Coverage is measured using the [JaCoCo plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html). It includes both types of tests and must exceed **80%**.

### Continuous integration

For continuous integration I used [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). On every PR, it verifies whether the commit follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Then it runs `gradle build`, which checks the following:

* Code compilation
* Unit and functional tests
* Static code analysis
* Test coverage

### Build Scan

At the end of the CI process, a [Build Scan](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/build_scans.html) is published to https://scans.gradle.com. An example [Build Scan](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/build_scans.html) from an execution can be found [here](https://scans.gradle.com/s/6tu3f64xfst2q).

### Compatibility tests

While building the plugin, it was important to ensure compatibility with multiple versions of [Gradle](https://gradle.org), as well as both [Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) and [Groovy DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/groovy_build_script_primer.html). Thatâ€™s why on every PR, in addition to the previously mentioned steps, compatibility tests are run. They execute the `initSpringBootProject` task on different versions of [Gradle](https://gradle.org) using the following directories:

* `examples/simple-groovy`
* `examples/simple-kotlin`

All of this is possible thanks to the [matrix strategy in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations). More about it can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations).

### Continuous delivery

After the CI process described above, when a commit lands in `main`, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) triggers a workflow that uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to manage changes in `CHANGELOG.md`, create a new tag with a release in the repository, and publish the plugin to [Gradle - Plugins](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

---

## Summary

While building [gradle-springinitializr-plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.oczadly.springinitializr), I not only enjoyed recreating `gradle init` for [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), going through [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog) courses, exploring the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) API, [Gradle best practices](https://docs.gradle.org/9.0.0/userguide/best_practices_general.html), [Spock](https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.0/spock_primer.html) and [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/style-guide.html). I am also fully satisfied with the final result. This is not just another sample plugin. It is a tool **ready to use** locally and as part of a platform â€” built consciously, solidly, and following the best patterns.

For Platform Engineers itâ€™s a ready-to-use asset for the platform, for Software Engineers â€“ a quick start in daily work, and for explorers â€“ a practical reference for building Gradle plugins.
